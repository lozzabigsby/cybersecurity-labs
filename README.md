# Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity labs across offensive and defensive environments. It includes penetration testing exercises, network detection labs, and structured incident response investigations using industry-standard tools.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate practical security analysis, detection engineering, and offensive testing skills through clear documentation and repeatable workflows.
